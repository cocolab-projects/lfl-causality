## Experiments

1. Game-1
- Single player, observe 12 critters (4 x 3 species), either given "pepsin detector" or "book with names", vague communicative goal.
- n = 18 ($0.50) --> $9 + 20% = $10.80

2. Game-2
- Single player, observe 12 critters (4 x 3 species)
- 2 sets of distributions:
  - [1, 1, 0.25], [1, 1, 0.5]
  - Category 1 has 100% color1, Category 2 has 100% color2, Category 3 has 25% or 50% color3 (remainder is color1 or color2)
- 2 prompts
  - Listener will have to "find feps" vs. "find all of the feps"
- n = 9 x 4 = 36 ($0.75) --> $27 + 5.4 (20%) = $32.40

## Dyadic

1.  

2. Boolean category learning
- 6 Shepard concept
- n = 12 dyads (x participants)
- N = 24
- cost = $2.50 (+ bonus)
- base pay = 2.5*24 = 60 + 40% = 84
