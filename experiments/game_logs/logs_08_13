student said Got it. I'm thinking that redase, bluease and yellowase together will also give all three.
explorer said if greenase is mixed with redase it does not glow, does not bubble, conducts electricity
explorer said yeah, I also tested, redase, yellowase, bluease, and greensase it also gave all three
explorer said but it seems that nothing will glow unless red and blue are together
