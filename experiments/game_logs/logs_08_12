explorer said Red glows. Yellow glows and conducts. Blue bubbles. Green does nothing. Purple does nothing. When you mix glow with something that doesnt have glow, it ends up with glow. When you mix bubbles with something that doesnt have bubbles, there are no bubbles in the end. No conductivity mixed with conductivity always results in the final result being conductive

explorer said Red just bubbles. Yellow and blue both only conduct electricity. Green and purple both do nothing. When mixing, the end result has all the effects of each individual chemical, like bubbles
explorer said So red + yellow would be just bubbles and conductivity
explorer said And there are no glowing chemicals this time
