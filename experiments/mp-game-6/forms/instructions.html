          <b>Scenario: </b>In this HIT, imagine that you are an employee of "ChemCo", a company 
          which studies chemicals on other planets. Your goal in this HIT is to learn how 
          to identify the causes of chemical reactions. 
          
          <br> <br>
          <b>Explorer:</b> You are the explorer, and you will be able to interact with chemicals to learn about
          what type of reactions occur. You will be able to experiment with the chemicals as much as you want.  
          When you are ready to proceed, you will continue to a chatroom where you will communicate your
          findings about the chemicals. These findings will be used to test a later student (your partner), and you will
          recieve a bonus based on that student's performance. <strong>This later student will only have access to your
          findings, and won't be able to experiment, so make sure to be thorough.</strong> 
          You will then be given a series of around 10 questions about the chemicals. Once you have finished
          with one set of chemicals, you will continue, repeating this process 
          (exploration, chatroom communication, assessment) for a total of 3 different groups of chemicals.
          <br> <br>
          <b>Bonus:</b> At the end of each test, you will receive a
          score:
          (# of questions correctly answered)
          At the very end, we will sum together your scores across the rounds with
          <b>your partner's scores</b> across the rounds. This will be the total score for both players.
          You will each get <b> a bonus of $0.01 per point</b>, so pay attention and communicate effectively!

        <p> A few final notes: 
        <p>
          Please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once
          you start the game (including the waiting page). If you
          refresh, you will not be able to rejoin the game you were in
          and you may not be able to submit the HIT. Similarly, DO NOT
          exit this tab once the game opens in another tab. This tab must be
          open for the HIT to submit.<br> Thank you!
        </p>
