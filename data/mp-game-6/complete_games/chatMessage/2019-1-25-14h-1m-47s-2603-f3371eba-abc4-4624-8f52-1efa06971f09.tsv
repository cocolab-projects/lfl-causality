It seemed that most of the zorbs had all of those characteristics, though a few lacked head feathers.	45.292	chatMessage	F	Q

Here's what I found. Ollers are fish that look like catfish. Some have stripes, some do not. When they have white stripes (not colored stripes), they always an oller, except when the white-striped fish lacks a fang and whiskers, or only has one of those two things. 	75.77	chatMessage	I	Q

Not a ton of consistencies here either. They're kind of bug-looking things. Lots of the ones with purple wings were whatever the species is. Also, ones with white legs and no wings also counted.	40.867	chatMessage	I	Q
