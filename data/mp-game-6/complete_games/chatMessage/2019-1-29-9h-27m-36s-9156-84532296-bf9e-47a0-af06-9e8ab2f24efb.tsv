The correct ones are the trees with no leaves. Color does not matter. If the berries are there or not doesn't matter. Just no leaves. 	55.768	chatMessage	F	G

It is correct if it has white legs The only exception to that rule is if it also has white wings then it is wrong. Any one with orange antenna  is also correct regarldess of what color everything else is. 	1.3359999999999999	chatMessage	I	Q

However, they are fish, and all the fish that had whiskers were correct. So to be safe I guess just pick all the ones with whiskers. 	72.657	chatMessage	I	Q
