They look like trees. The species is mostly the one with the leaves and are larger. There is no set color pattern so it will be difficult to choose which the species is. There can be 1, 2 or 3 different colors of the trunk, leaves, and berries going to have to guess on this one.	1.105	chatMessage	I	Q
